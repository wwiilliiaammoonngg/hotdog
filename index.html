<h1>Super Special Hot Dogs</h1>
<p>The story behind the Super Special Hot Dogs goes like this.</p>
<p>I was walking down the street and a hot dog guy was like, "Hey, do you want a super special hot dog?</p>
<p>I was like, "I don't know, whats the deal with the hot dog?"</p>
<p>He said, "Oh, you haven't heard of my hot dogs?"</p>
<p>I said, "No."</p>
<p>And he said, "Do you wanna try?"</p>
<p>And I said, "What?"</p>
<p>And he said, "Do you wanna try?"</p>
<p>And I said, "Yeah."</p>
<p>And then he said some weird stuff and I can't remember what it was.</p>
<p>So I tried the hot dog, and it was good. So I made my own recipe for the super special hot dog.</p>
